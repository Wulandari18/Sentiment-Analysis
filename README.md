# Sentiment-Analysis

Hello!

This year, I joined Bootcamp about Advance Python - Data Science which is held by Sanbercode. In the last project, I build UI to save, process and analyze data from twitter. In the app, there is 5 menu:
1. Updating Data
2. Updating Sentiment Values
3. Showing Data
4. Data Visualization
5. Exit

Here, I share my code to build this app. To run the code, we need some following packages:
1. tweepy
2. re
3. pandas 
4. matplotlib
5. NumPy
6. Sqlite3
7. Datetime

If any discussion about this app, please contact me at wulanddarii18@gmail.com.

Enjoy it!
