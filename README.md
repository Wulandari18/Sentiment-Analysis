# Sentiment-Analysis

Hello!

This year, I joined Bootcamp about Advance Python - Data Science which is held by Sanbercode. In the last project, I build UI to save, process and analyze data from twitter. In the app, there is 7 menus:
1. Input and update Twitter data into the database.
2. Input and update sentiments into the database.
3. Display data.
4. Sentiment visualization.
5. Display top accounts based on the number of likes and retweets regarding the Covid-19 vaccine post.
6. Display top accounts based on the numbe of followers and following.
7. Exit

Here, I share my code to build this app. To run the code, we need some following packages:
1. tweepy
2. re
3. pandas 
4. matplotlib
5. NumPy
6. Sqlite3
7. Datetime

If any discussion about this app, please contact me at wulanddarii18@gmail.com.

Enjoy it!
